In a big beautiful palace there lived an old king who fell very sick one day. He had many servants and among them was a good servant Jose who had won the king s heart. The king thought that he was lying on his death-bed…so he said, "Let faithful Jose come to me." 


Faithful Jose was his affectionate servant and was called so because he had been true to him all his lifetime. As soon as Jose came to the bedside, the king said, "My faithful Jose. I feel that my end approaches and I am worried about my son who is still so young that he cannot always guide himself aright. If you do not promise to instruct him in everything he ought to know and be his guardian, I cannot close my eyes in peace." 


Then Jose answered, "I will never leave him. I will always serve him truly, even if it costs my own life." So the king was very happy and said, "Now I can die in peace. After my death, you must show him all the chambers, halls and vaults in the castle and all the treasures which are in them. But the last room in the long corridor you must not show him. Because in it hangs the portrait of the daughter of the king of the golden palace… if he sees her picture, he will fall in great love with her and will fall down in a swoon and on her account will undergo great troubles. Therefore you must keep him away."


The faithful Jose pressed his master’s hand again in token of his promise and a little later the king laid his head upon the pillow and expired.
